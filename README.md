# Unilogin PHP package

A PHP helper package that wraps some of the methods you need to communicate with 'Infotjenesten' from the danish ministry of education and to build authentication URLs for unilogin.

The naming of the project is slightly misleading as the Infotjenesten integration is the primary feature, but they are almost always used in conjunction and unilogin is the most common way to mention it.
